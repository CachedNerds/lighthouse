**WIP** [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/home/) homeserver implementation. This 
will eventually be a fully-functioning distributed chat platform. 

A few goals:
- implement the [the Matrix homeserver spec](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/) including interop with third-party services
- create a reference client
